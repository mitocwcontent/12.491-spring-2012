Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisite
------------

Permission of instructor

Summary
-------

This course is designed for graduate students with an interest in using primary research literature to discuss and learn about current research around non-conventional light stable isotope geochemistry.

Format
------

This course will meet weekly for one and a half hours. During the regular class session, we will analyze two to three papers in a discussion-based format. Each class will conclude with a brief outline of the following week's class introduced by the instructors, or at the beginning of the class for sessions led by guest lecturers. Each student will pick one topic for presentation, and write up a one-page handout.

Gradings
--------

This course is graded pass/fail, based upon the contribution to the discussion session.
